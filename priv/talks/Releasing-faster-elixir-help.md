# Releasing faster: How can Elixir help us

The faster you get your commits in production, the more commercially successful you are. This is the empirically proven result coming from the DevOps community.  We will first look at how can we speed up our build and deployment with Elixir. What are the existing strategies to deploy our code in production, with the current state of the art, allowing you to deploy in minutes.

We will then look at what are the limits of the current deployment model limits. And how the BEAM could participate in creating a new model, that would allow us to deploy in seconds.
