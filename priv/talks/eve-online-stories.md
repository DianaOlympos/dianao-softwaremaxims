# Eve online organisations through stories

Warning: this talk will have some strong words. 

I am a gamer. Not a particularly skilled gamer that said. Any time of real time strategy game, i will be bad at it. But i am a gamer and i think being part of the gaming community, involved as i am, taught me a lot about building resilient organisations. 

Online competitive games and the community of players around them are amazing to learn more about resilient team and resilient organisations. Games naturally create a sociotechnical system akin to the one we are part of everyday in IT. They have complex rules, that you only see as a model you build of them. They are social. Most involve being part of a team and collaborating, sometimes on the spot. They also involve generally an organisation far bigger than that. Clans, guilds, but also bigger communities. They naturally reproduce the type of high pressure-high cadence environment we study in incidents. On top of that, they reproduce this environment all the time. Gamers are forged in the fire of incidents everyday.

I have played eve online for a few year. I am still part of the eve community, but i do not play regularly. Mostly because eve become rapidly a second job and ... i already have two of them. It had a visible impact on me. I mean, my avatar online is usually this. This is Diana Olympos, my name everywhere online. I had it before i played Eve. This is my main character in eve. In a lot of way, it is me and my face far more than the one you are seeing right now.  So who knows in the future. Eve online is a MMO. A Massively Multiplayer Online Game. In Eve, you do not connect with 10 players in a game of 45 min. In Eve online, the size of your organisation can grow to 20 thousands players.

Gaming organisations also face other really interesting challenges akin to ours. Their first problem is hiring and retention. Gaming is a free time activity. What it means is that your members can leave anytime. You are not paying them. They do not depend on you for their food, roof or family. You are what they do after they took care of their most important things in life. They will leave in a minute, they can drop off unexpectedly, what we call "real life happens". So any gaming organisation will have this huge turnover and this huge revolving door. Keeping people motivated and feeling at home helps countering this.

Which brings to the second problem. Onboarding and teaching. They have to teach really complex systems and mechanics really fast. The revolving door of members means that you have a few hours of their free time to ramp them up to a level they will be an asset for you. The constant need for new players means that you will not be able to select only "A-level players". You will get what you get and you have to build your organisation with it.

Finally, especially for eve online, you have to be distributed. Remote-only. That is not a choice. And remember the free time things ? yeah you are not going to be able to force things like a standup everyday. 

So to recap, gaming organisations face:
    - highly complex sociotechnical systems
    - with constant high pressure-high cadence events
    - hiring and motivation problems
    - Need to teach and onboard rapidly new members
    - Remote-only with hectic schedules

All these things makes learning from them something that can profit us. Today i want to try to offer you some of the learning we can get.

Eve Online has a particularity for a MMO. It is single sharded sandbox. It is in the same shard since 2003. That means that whatever impact you have on the game will be reflected forever in Eve. And it will affect everyone else that play the game. Eve decided to double down on that idea of consequences. In eve online, if you die, you lose everything you had equipped at that moment. Boom. You can buy new ships and new equipment of course, you can keep playing. But actions you take in space have consequences. On top of that, nearly all the equipment is built by a player controlled economy. Creating new ships take time, a complex production system, and you will probably sell them on an open market where other players compete with you. Finally, you can always attack other players. There are no safe mode in eve. Your attack may have consequences that will cost you in some part of the universe, but it is your choice to deal with them. If you want to shoot someone, the game will not stop you.

What that mean is that in eve online, the social part is even more important. And that means you get organisation of all size, from the small corporation of 10 friends to the massive coalition like The Imperium of probably around 20 thousands active players. It also means these organisations have a real structure. They provide services to their members, they collect taxes, they offer doctrines and rules. They have directors, managers, line members. They also have a history and a purpose. And usually some values. More importantly for us they have stories.

Dumb ways to dies as intro

Stories are amazing. We regularly talk of how incidents reports and postmortem are a way of telling stories. Multiple stories of the same event usually. Stories are how we, humans, understand systems. They are the vehicule for a lot of our "soft" learnings. They are the way we use to communicate mental model. So today, i want to present you with stories. Stories from eve online. Stories, big and small, that are used everyday by these organisations and in these organisations to teach the sociotechnical system and keep it working. I will only tell you one version of the story. I will not tell you what you should learn from the story either. If you want other versions of these stories or if you want to learn more, i will ask you to come talk to me later.

So Dumbs ways to die. Does anyone remember the game ? or the spots ? It was in 2013 and it was a fun little game to try to help with safety. Quite a good game design by the way. Really worked. What you saw is a parody done by the Eve community. That said... it is interesting because you see it is not only a parody. They kept something that was essential to the original clip and song. And they amped it up to 11. They made it a teaching tool. A tool for people that listen to enquire and ask.

The lyrics are short, but every single line is a lesson to learn or a link to a story to listen to. Stories that build the folklore of most eve online players. Let me show some of them.

"Make fun of the Mittani's hair"
The Mittani is the leader and head of one of the biggest and oldest corporation, alliance and coalition in Eve Online. He lead GoonSwarm. He is despised by nearly everyone. He is at that job for nearly 10 years. He is probably the most powerful player in eve online. I do not like him, nor his philosophy around the game. He is a controversial figure in the community. He is well known to lie his ass off and to "spin" anything, even the worst defeat, into a victory. To the point that this meme is how he is seen by most of the community http://spinmaster.space/ . Making fun of his hair, which are indeed funny, can be an easy way to get problems in the wrong crows indeed. There have been wars for less. This little bees ? They are the goonswarm logo.

"Bring AWOXers into corp"
This one lost a bit of its edge, because the game added a little design change since then. But it is still relevant. AWOX-ing is the act of being hired into an organisation, then turning coats during a fight and just firing at allies. It is not considered a real spy, double agent or traitor, because it is rarely controlled by an enemy entity. It is mostly just people that get their fun at seeing the world burn (insert heith leadger joker image). Bringing them in your corporation can indeed be problematic.

"Disconnect when 10% TiDi'd"

TiDi. Time Dilatation. This one is a special one. Software systems for games have an interesting problem. You see, they are hard realtime. If, like eve online, you run at one tick per second, then all the computation of the simulation need to be finished in 1 second. If at the end of that second, you have not finished your main loop for that tick, then the system crash or, worse, being to desynchronize, with different clients living in different realities. This is a problem for eve online. Usually you deal with it by sharding right. You make sure that whatever happens, there is never enough players to overload your server. Well eve online is single sharded. There are "shards". Each solar system is one. But if you get players that want to all fight together... they need to be in the same system. That proved a problem when organisations grew and fleets in battle grew with it.

So CCP, the developers of eve online, introduced Time Dilatation. If the server get heavily loaded, he will dilate time in that particular system. So you are still at 1 tick per second... but a second is a bit more than a second. In maximum TiDi, 10%, one second in game is 10 second in real life. And that does not mean there are still no desynchronization and no action missed. If you disconnect in space during a fight, you normally stay up there for a long time. In 10% Tidi? it will be forever.

"Jump your Leviathan into Asakai"
Ah one of these big stories. The battle of Asakai.

"Be too confident you can take a region"
In eve online, organisations can take control of some zone of space. As a player, you can plant your flag there and then evolve them in multiple ways to get bonus, produce new ships, etc. This usually mean that to get some area of space, you will have to deal with the existing owner. You can rent space. You can make a deal to get it. You can buy space. Or you can just decide that you know... you are going to war.

War in eve is serious business. It means getting pilots in fleet at precise time, it means bringing them to the correct place at that time. It means being able to equip them correctly for the fight. It means they need to know how to fight. A war is something you can only do if you are a really resilient organisation. And sometimes well... you are too confident about your capabilities. This graphic is about [insert war in question here]

Winning wars is rarely about the fights themselves. They are about logistic, coordination, morale. Keeping people up and running. I will end with a song if i have time.

Remember what i told you ? these organisations are free time only and remote first. And still they can pull out this kind of really complex, highly cooperative situations. I will not go into more details on the way they exchange information and the way they work, but i would like to point out that they are doing that for more than 15 years. And they are doing it well. If you want to go for a distributed first, remote, efficient setup, there are probably things to learn here. Same for handling incidents. They would not win wars otherwise.
