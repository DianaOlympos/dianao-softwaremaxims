# Infrastructure is People

abstract:
The promise of automation was to bring more power to the application developer. We built layers upon layers of infrastructure trying to achieve that goal. The rise of “DevOps” as a specialty shows that using this automation is not so automated after all. We have failed.

This talk will present the state of DevOps tooling through the lens of human centered-design. We will see how we could use this lens to build automation that enhance us instead of failing at replacing us.

This talk will present the state of DevOps tooling through the lens of human centered-design, and how it could have helped enhance our capabilities as operators rather than the current approach that aims to replace us.

The current approach aims to replace us, and can’t. In this talk, we’ll present an approach based on Human-centered design, use it to look at the state of DevOps tooling, and how it could help us enhance our capabilities as fundamental parts of the system instead.
