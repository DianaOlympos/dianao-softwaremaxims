Tailwind - The Utility-First CSS Framework

A project by Adam Wathan (@adamwathan), Jonathan Reinink (@reinink),
David Hemphill (@davidhemphill) and Steve Schoger (@steveschoger).

Welcome to the Tailwind config file. This is where you can customize
Tailwind specifically for your project. Don't be intimidated by the
length of this file. It's really just a big JavaScript object and
we've done our very best to explain each section.

    |
    | Here you can specify the colors used in your project. To get you started,
    | we've provided a generous palette of great looking colors that are perfect
    | for prototyping, but don't hesitate to change them for your project. You
    | own these colors, nothing will break if you change everything about them.
    |
    | We've used literal color names ("red", "blue", etc.) for the default
    | palette, but if you'd rather use functional names like "primary" and
    | "secondary", or even a numeric scale like "100" and "200", go for it.
    |
    | The color palette defined above is also assigned to the "colors" key of
    | your Tailwind config. This makes it easy to access them in your CSS
    | using Tailwind's config helper. For example:
    |
    | .error { color: config('colors.red') }
